    slow = slow.next;
    if (fast === slow) return true;
  }

  return false;
};

### ts 


Here’s the **TypeScript version** of the cycle detection function with a step-by-step explanation in comments:

```ts
class ListNode {
  val: number;
  next: ListNode | null;
  constructor(val: number, next: ListNode | null = null) {
    this.val = val;
    this.next = next;
  }
}

function hasCycle(head: ListNode | null): boolean {
  let slow: ListNode | null = head;
  let fast: ListNode | null = head;

  while (fast && fast.next) {
    slow = slow!.next;
    fast = fast.next.next;
    if (slow === fast) return true;
  }

  return false;
}
```

### Example:
```ts
const nodeA = new ListNode(1);
const nodeB = new ListNode(2);
const nodeC = new ListNode(3);
const nodeD = new ListNode(4);

nodeA.next = nodeB;
nodeB.next = nodeC;
nodeC.next = nodeD;
nodeD.next = nodeB; // cycle here

console.log(hasCycle(nodeA)); // true
```

### ✅ Time and Space Complexity of `hasCycle` (Floyd’s Algorithm):

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`  
  - In the worst case, `fast` and `slow` traverse the entire list.
  - If there’s a cycle, `fast` catches up to `slow` in at most `n` steps.

- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`  
  - No extra data structures are used — just two pointers.

This makes Floyd’s algorithm optimal for cycle detection in linked lists.

Let’s walk through an example to explain how the **Floyd's Cycle Detection** algorithm works.

### Example:

Linked List with a cycle:
```
A → B → C → D → E
          ↑     ↓
          ← ← ← 
```
In memory: `E.next = C` creates a cycle back to C.

---

### Step-by-step:

- **Initial Pointers:**
  - `slow = A`
  - `fast = A`

---

### Iteration 1:
- `slow = B` (1 step)
- `fast = C` (2 steps)

---

### Iteration 2:
- `slow = C`
- `fast = E`

---

### Iteration 3:
- `slow = D`
- `fast = D`

---

### 🎯 At this point: `slow === fast` → **cycle detected**, return `true`.

---

### Key Idea:
- `slow` moves one node at a time.
- `fast` moves two nodes at a time.
- If there's a cycle, `fast` will eventually catch up to `slow`.
